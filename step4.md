# Conversion from ONNX to CoreML

I have divided the conversion in 4 parts, hoping that it will be more clear:

- [Part 1](step4_part1.md): Model conversion
- [Part 2](step4_part2.md): Display CoreML model specifications
- [Part 3](step4_part3.md): Test CoreML model on one image
- [Part 4](step4_part4.md): Test CoreML model on the test set
